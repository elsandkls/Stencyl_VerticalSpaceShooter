# Stencyl_VerticalSpaceShooter
Tool a Udemy class, the teacher was excellent. The goal was to find a GUI programming interface that a child in the 9 to 13 yr old range would be able to use and understand. If Stencyl worked it would have been perfect. Unfortunately the compiler portion stopped working after an update that was released in early 2018, and according to the support forums there was not patch in sight. The GUI itself is quite food in the initial stages the comiler was working quite well. If they fix it I will revisit the software. For now, this is the game as it was when the GUI and compiler quite working. Unfortunately it doesn't generate enough source code to even take that to a different compiler so the project is stalled. The program was mostly complete, I was just debugging it.
