# Stencyl_VerticalSpaceShooter
Took a Udemy class about programming games in Stencyl, the teacher was excellent. The goal was to find a GUI programming interface that a child in the 9 to 13 yr old range would be able to use and understand. If Stencyl worked it would have been perfect. Unfortunately the compiler portion stopped working after an update that was released in early 2018 (I did not apply any patches until (roughly) August 2018, and according to the support forums there was no patch in sight. The GUI itself is quite good, and before the patch I was able to generate the code and test it for multiple platforms. If they fix it I will revisit the software. For now, this is the game as it was when the GUI and compiler quit working. Unfortunately it doesn't generate enough source code to even take that to a different compiler so the project is stalled. The program was mostly complete, I was just debugging it.
